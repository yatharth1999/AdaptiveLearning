# Car-Based Math Operation Game

A unique educational game designed to help primary school students learn the four basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) in a fun and interactive way. This is currently the **only car-based mathematics operation game** that uses **adaptive learning** based on each user’s performance **and** the emotions they display while playing. We focus on **three emotion features**: **surprise**, **sad**, and **neutral**.

## Overview

- **A Mini-Game**: The application contains one mini-game that make practicing math operations easy, engaging, and enjoyable.  
- **Adaptive Learning**: The game adjusts question difficulty according to each player’s performance and emotional feedback.  
- **Emotion Tracking**: We capture emotional states – surprise, sad, and neutral – to tailor the gameplay experience and provide personalized feedback.

2. **Emotion-Based Adaptation**
